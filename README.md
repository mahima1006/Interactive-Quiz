## Task description :
For the completion of this task, I have used Visual Studio Code as the development environment. The goal was to create an interactive quiz web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz system is designed to be simple yet functional, allowing users to test their knowledge on multiple topics with immediate feedback.The application begins with an index.html file, which serves as the homepage. This homepage displays the main heading and presents the user with three distinct quiz categories: HTML Quiz, GK (General Knowledge) Quiz, and Science Quiz. Each button links to a different quiz page specifically created for that topic.
Each quiz contains a set of 5 multiple-choice questions, each with 4 answer options. When a user selects an answer, the system uses the setTimeout function in JavaScript to introduce a 1 second pause,before showing whether their answer was correct or not. This small delay enhances the user experience by providing a realistic quiz environment.
Feedback is provided instantly after each answer. If the selected option is correct, the user receives a positive message such as “You're Correct!” in green text. If the answer is wrong, the message “Oops wrong answer!” appears in red. The text coloring is given by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). The quiz progresses automatically to the next question after the feedback, ensuring smooth navigation through the quiz.
At the end of the 5 questions, the final score is displayed dynamically. This score tells the user how many questions they got right out of the total. To improve user interactivity and flexibility, “Go back to main” button is also provided – This takes the user back to the homepage (index.html) to try a different quiz.
The frontend styling has been handled using both internal and external CSS, allowing for a clean and visually appealing interface. Elements such as buttons, question boxes, and feedback messages are styled with appropriate colors, padding, margin and spacing to maintain consistency and readability.

Applications of this quiz platform:
This Interactive quiz application can be used for various purposes like education platforms, it can be put to use as a self assessment tool helping students to learn and improve themselves at their own pace. they can be used as prep tools, very similar to using flash cards.
